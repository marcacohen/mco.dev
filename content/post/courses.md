Anyone can understand technology and learn to code.
All it takes is regular practice, some determination, 
and a good teacher. That's where I come in. I want to help you learn some
useful skills. **If you are Palestinian, a women, a person of color, or a member
of any other group that is underrepresented in tech, I'll teach you for free.**
Others will be requested to pay a nominal fee, 100% of which goes to one of the
wonderful charities curated by
<a href="https://growingwatermelons.com" target="_blank">Growing Watermelons</a>.

All my courses are:
- **inclusive** - no prerequisites, perfect for beginners
- **approachable** - nothing to install or configure on your computer
- **affordable** - free for most, low cost charitable donation for others
- **ad-free** - no ads on my site or my course material, not now, not ever
- **practical** - understand not only the how, but the why
- **interactive** - learn by doing, using Colab notebooks and other interactive tools

## Intro to Python

<details>
<summary>
(Click here to expand course description.)<br>
Python is a very popular programming language, probably the most widely used in the world nowadays. It's particularly used for AI and Data Science, which has propelled its recent growth. I find it one of the most expressive and natural programming languages. As some people like to say, "it fits my brain", and I agree.

## Intro to AI

My goal for this course is to help you understand AI well enough to engage in an intelligent conversation, to understand how it works, a bit about where it came from, and some of the limitations and concerns (both technological and ethical). It won't get anyone a job overnight but it will hopefully be a useful step toward understanding a technology that is revolutionizing our world.
</summary>

### Prerequisites

Why are you doing this?
</summary>
<br>
<img style="margin-right: 20px" height="250" align="left" src="/img/everyone.png" />
As the great Tim Berners-Lee said about his historic invention
(the World Wide Web): "this is for everyone". I want to make technology
understable for everyone, especially those people who haven't felt "invited
to the party".

<summary>
Free? Really? What's the catch?
</summary>
<br>
There is no catch. I don't need the money so everything here is free, apart from donations I solicit for those who already have some advantages and can afford to pay a small fee.
