Anyone can learn technology. All it takes is practice, some determination, 
and a good teacher. That's where I come in. I want to help you learn some
useful skills. If you are Palestinian, a women, a person of color, or a member
of any other groups that is underrepresented in tech, I'll teach you for free.
Others will be required to pay a nominal fee, 100% of which goes to one of the
stratefic charities curated by
<a href="https://growingwatermelons.com" target="_blank">Growing Watermelons</a>.

My courses are:
- inclusive - no prerequisites, perfect for beginners
- approachable - nothing to install or configure
- convenient - learn at your pace, on your schedule
- affordable - free for most, low cost charitable donation for others
- ad-free - no adds now, no ads ever
- practical - understand not only how, but why
- respectful - we never request or store any personal information
- interactive - learn by doing, using Colab notebooks
