I'm often asked to recommend a book to help students get started learning Python. There are many good ones, but this one, by Jake VanderPlas, is my favorite for the absolute beginner.

It's not deep, but that's an advantage -- you don't want to get too bogged down in details when you're just starting out. In less than 100 pages, this book provides a guided tour of the essential things you should know in order to get started using Python.
And the price is right too: it's free.
