I offer free remote guest lectures for high school and university classes.

<!--more-->

## Why?

Because I like teaching and I want to demystify technology. You no longer need to be a wizard to leverage the latest computing tools but the word hasn't entirely gotten around yet.

## Who are you anyway?

You can find out more about me [here](/about).

## What would you talk about?

Modern information tools have never been more powerful and accessible, but it still helps to have a friendly tour guide. My goal is to make the computing revolution (cloud computing, Python programming, open source, machine learning, data science), easier to understand and more inclusive for students of all ages.

## Ok, but what *specifically* would you talk about?

You can see my catalog of current talks [here](/my-talks). I can tailor those to any duration or academic level. Given a little extra time, I can even create a new talk, just for your class.

## How much does this cost?

If your class is composed primarily of women, LGBT, and/or students of color, my lectures are free. If not, I ask that you donate $50 per lecture to one of these charities:

<br>

* [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [Malala Fund](https://malala.org/)

## How do I sign up?
