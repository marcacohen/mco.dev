I offer free online lectures and full courses on computing and data science.

<!--more-->

## Who are these classes for?

The target audience is high school and university students, but I'm open to teaching other groups as well.

## Why are these classes important?

The goal is to demystify technology, to make it more accessible and more inclusive for students of all ages.

## Who will be teaching?

You can find out more about me [here](/about-marc). Modern computing tools have never been more powerful and accessible, but it still helps to have a friendly tour guide. 

## Are the classes free?

For groups composed primarily of women, LGBT, and/or minorities, these classes are free.  For others, a donation of $50 per lecture is requested to benefit one of the following:

* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
* [Malala Fund](https://malala.org/)
