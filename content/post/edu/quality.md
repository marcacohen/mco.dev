Take a guess what percentage of students in low income countries reach the end of primary school lacking basic reading skills.

<!--more-->

In the world's poorest countries, by the end of grade school 90% of students are unable to read with comprehension. Not surprisingly, results are much better, though still surprisingly bad, in the world's richest countries, where the corresponding figure is 9%.

I recommend reading <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/better-learning" target="_blank">this article</a> to get the full story but I'll summarize the key findings here:

- The percentage for the best performing countries is one the order of 2% so it's possible to do much better. 
- You can't improve something if you don't measure it. Most countries focus on attendance, which is not a good proxy for actual learning. Being present is necessary but not sufficient.
- Unequal learning mirrors income inequality. The larger the income inequality, the greater the learning inquality.
- The differences between countries are several times larger than the differences within countries.

> In some of the world’s richest countries, like Finland, the education system is a great equalizer – it gives every child a chance, no matter what their family background is.

> These educational differences are perpetuating high levels of inequality. Children from richer backgrounds tend to learn much more and grow up to become more skilled and productive and make themselves and their countries richer in turn.

> If we want to stop inequality perpetuating itself through education, we have to raise the quality of education for hundreds of millions of children. The most successful countries show that this is possible.


If we really want to have a world in which everyone has equal opportunity to learn, earn, and contribute, it's hard to imagine a more strategic investment than primary education.

The de facto assumption is that people who identify as male prefer he/him, those who identify as female prefer she/her, and others (e.g. non-binary folks) prefer they/them, however, any perceived or assumed gender identity should always be overridden by a stated preference.

Fair enough, but this implies that I need to maintain a mental map of everyone I know, whether they've ever shared a pronoun preference, and, if so, which one. I'm not good at this sort of thing so I've come up with a solution: **from now on, I'm using they/them/their for everyone**, except when someone indicates a clear preference for gender specificity.

To make this more explicit:

| old             | new             |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| he/him/his      | they/them/their |
| she/her/hers    | they/them/their |
| they/them/their | they/them/their |

This is efficient (one set of pronouns instead of three), inclusive (assumes nothing about gender), and doesn't tax my toddler sized memory. It has the added advantage of versatility: the same pronouns work for both singular and plural cases.
