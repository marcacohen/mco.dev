## Overview

Computer programming has become a fundamental skill of our modern world. Data processing now permeates just about every field of study and every profession. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that those who understand computer programming are likely to enjoy greater opportunity.

This course teaches basic Python Programming with an emphasis on being:

<br>

- Practical - Every week we'll solve real problems because I want you to understand not only how to do things, but why.
- Interactive - All course material (lecture notes, homework, exercises, etc.) are delivered via interactive notebooks, which promotes active learning.
- Approachable - There are no prerequisites and nothing to install or configure - all you need to get started is a web browser.
- Team Based - We'll form small groups to help you learn from each other. The course will culminate in a group project, which each team will share at our final class.
