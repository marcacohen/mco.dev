In the mid-90s I got interested in the stock market and had a bit of money to invest so I opened an account with Charles Schwab.

Schwab had recently introduced a service called Telebroker, which enabled clients to trade stocks by telephone. One morning in 1995, I asked my wife to buy $2,500 worth of Microsoft stock via Telebroker. What could possibly go wrong?
Later that morning, I received a panicky call from her. Instead of buying 2,500 dollars, she’d inadvertently purchased 2,500 **shares** of Microsoft. At the time, Microsoft was selling at roughly $50 per share so we’d just bet $125,000 on one highly volatile tech stock. Even worse, we had nowhere near that amount of cash in our account but because this was a so-called “margin account” (which meant Schwab extended us an automatic credit line), we’d just borrowed $125,000 to make a wildly speculative purchase.

Of course, we did what any responsible investor would do – we immediately sold the stock. But because it dropped 1/8 of a point that day, and due to the normal spread between the buy and sell price, plus sales commissions, the mistake ended up costing us nearly $1,000. Lesson learned.

Since then, I’ve often wondered what would have happened if we’d been crazy enough to let it ride. Adjusting for splits, in the five years from 1995 to 2022, Microsoft appreciated by roughly a factor of 50. So, if we’d held onto our investment until this year, instead of costing us a thousand dollars, it would have earned us $6 million.
