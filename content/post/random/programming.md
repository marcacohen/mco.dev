I just read this article: [*Programming is Hard*](https://dorinlazar.ro/2021-02-programming-is-hard/). I agree with several points made therein, but I have a different way of explaining it.

I like to answer this question using an analogy:  **how hard is it to learn to play piano?**

It depends on your goals:

* Learning the basics and writing toy applications is easy, like learning the basics of music theory and how to play *Mary had a Little Lamb* with one hand.

* Becoming a professional programmer who builds complex real-world applications is hard. It takes years of work, just as becoming a professional pianist takes years of dedication and practice.

Most people live somewhere between these two extremes - able to enjoy coding and creating small to medium sized programs that solve interesting problems and give them joy, just as many piano players have enough skill to enjoy making music.

So my advice when someone asks me "should I learn to code?" is this:

If it sounds interesting to you, then by all means, do it! If it's not for you, you'll figure that out and you'll come away from the experience with more insight into this modern digital world. An added bonus: you'll be able to play the equivalent of *Mary Had a Little Lamb* on the computer (we call it "Hello World").

If it is for you, you'll get this feeling that you're being let in on a way to control the universe, a superpower, and you'll take it to a level dictated by your personal level of interest and drive, perhaps all the way to a new profession.

But don't expect to play Beethoven's fifth after your first lesson. And bear in mind that some people have innate gifts that take them further and faster than the rest of us. But don't let that discourage you. You don't have to be the greatest programmer ever, only good enough to enjoy yourself. **Don't compete with anyone but yourself**.

So, to answer the question in this article's title: no, everyone should not necessarily learn to code, but no one should be afraid to try. And if you don't like it, maybe try the piano. :)
