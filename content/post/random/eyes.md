Another case where AI does things we can't explain: apparently male and female retinas are different enough that a computer can predict your gender just by looking at your eyes.

In May of 2021, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89743-x" target="_blank">reported in *Nature*</a> a machine learning model that can determine a person's gender, with an 85% success rate, solely based on a retinal image. 

Because deep learning neural networks are computational black boxes, no one (yet) knows how the model does this trick. One clue: the model performs significantly worse in the presence of injury or disease of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis">fovea</a>, perhaps implicating that part of the retina as gender specific.

This is the kind of problem the growing field of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a> is meant to address. I find it ironic that we're building subfields of computer science, to understand the mysterious inner workins of software we we didn't write.

By the way, did you know this:
> The retina is the only tissue in the body where neural and vascular tissue can be visualized simultaneously in a non-invasive manner.
