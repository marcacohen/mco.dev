Another case where AI does things we can't explain: apparently male and female retinas are different enough that a computer can predict your gender just by looking at your eyes.

In May of 2021, researchers <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-89743-x" target="_blank">reported in *Nature*</a> a machine learning model that can determine a person's gender, with an 85% success rate, solely based on an image of one of their retinas. **The weirdest part**: because deep learning neural networks are computational black boxes, no one (yet) knows how the model figures that out.

One clue: the model performs significantly less well in the presence of injury or disease of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea_centralis">fovea</a>, suggesting that part of the retina is related to gender. This is the kind of problem the growing field of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a> is meant to address.

By the way, did you know this?
