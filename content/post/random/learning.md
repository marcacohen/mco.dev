The article linked below espouses a concept I've always found to be true but never fully appreciated as clearly as it is explained here.

The basic idea is "learn by doing" but I what I love most about this article is
the way the author provides a systematic approach to this philosophy. 
I've been trying to learn Machine Learning lately and have noticed how easy
it is to get bogged down in the details. Per's advice is perfect here: start building
something. You will initially be confused and unsure how to integrate what you
learn into a broader framework. Go with it. Let go of that perfectionist impulse
to understand every little detail. Right from the start you'll have a goal, you'll 
watch something come to life, and eventually, if you keep at it, the pieces
will fall into place.

As an aside, the writer here, <a href="https://twitter.com/perborgen" target="_blank">Per Harald Borgen</a>,
is one of the co-creators of an amazing new learning tool, which provides a seemingly magical experience:
the ability to pause a running video and play with the code in progress.
