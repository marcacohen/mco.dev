Three takeaways from this story:

<br>

- *Before your phone gets stolen*, come up with a plan for how to minimize the damage, as fast as possible, if/when it happens.
- When traveling, always keep a backup digital device with you, in case your primary device "disappears".
- Don't use your phone in crowded public places, like big city street corners.
