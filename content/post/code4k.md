I spend most of my professional time helping developers understand how to harness Google Cloud technology
to build great applications. But a recent engagement brought me somewhere I'd never been before, 
somewhere, I suspect, no other Google Developer Advocate has gone.

My home country, the United States, has the largest prison population in the world, and the 
second-highest per-capita incarceration rate.
Poverty, unequal economic and educational opportunities, substance abuse, an inequitable justice system,
and many other factors contribute to this state of affairs, and it seems clear
that the current system is focussed more on penalty than on rehabiliation.

I recently attended the UK opening of this
film about group therapy sessions held in a California prison:
<a class="embedly-card" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8OVXG2GhpQ">The Work</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
This movie inspired me to try to find out if there are organizations in the UK
dedicated to helping inmates make the transition back into society.

A quick search revealed <a href="https://www.code4000.org" target="_blank">www.code4000.org</a>,
which has precisely that mission. I emailed code4000's co-founder, Michael Taylor, to inquire
about volunteer teaching opportunities. He responded enthusiastically, explaining that the
program is currently operating on a trial basis at a medium security prison
for men, <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/everthorpe" target="_blank">HMP Humber</a>, three hours north of London by train. We arranged a half day teaching session. 

I was told the men had no direct access to the web so any programming exercises
or demonstrations would have to work entirely offline.
I was also advised that several participants were interested in web
programming and was asked to prepare some material on Javascript and Chrome Devtools.

As the men filed into the room, I wasn't sure what to expect. Some seemed shy, avoiding my glance,
others more outgoing, meeting me with a smile and a hearty handshake.
I taught a group of 16 men with diverse backgrounds, ages, and interests.

I wanted to tailor the agenda to
their needs so I summarized the material I'd brought with me, but also requested
topics they were interested in discussing.

Together we came up with the following list of topics:

- How does the web work? What happens when I enter google.com in my browser's search bar?
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QyXx_H5q_CrJLz1h9odPB83n4lYwrdrlRTLRgA3UwE4/edit" target="_blank">Chrome Devtools Tour</a>
- What is "the Cloud" and why should I care?
- Android vs. iOS vs. the Web, which one should I focus on?
- Which languages/platforms/environments should I invest in?
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TU01dp6OfEU1gUg7N42nEWDV_axK0eK74Qiatbx3y5M/edit" target="_blank">What's AI and Machine Learning all about?</a>
- <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b3I4JFK0VgnQ50CJtBsWJB7xW9znncjRxxB1k84yVhA/edit" target="_blank">Learning how to learn</a> - what's the best way to quickly learn new technical skills?
- SEO - how do I make my web site appear in Google's search index?
- Security
- Other languages of interest: SQL, Ruby on Rails

I also wanted to learn more about them and why they were taking this class,
so we went around the room quickly
introducing ourselves and mentioning
what sort of skills we are interested in learning.

We proceeded to spend about an hour and
a half in hands-on technical material
on JavaScript and Chrome Devtools.
The second half of the program focussed on
our discussion topics.
This portion was less lecture based and more of a free-flowing, spontenous conversation. 

Both portions were fun for me, but I think I
enjoyed the unstructured time the most. 
I found these men to be attentive, highly 
engaged, and curious.
We covered a lot of ground, had some good laughs,
and learned a lot from each other.

If you live in the UK and enjoy teaching technical skills to motivated students,
I'd highly recommend checking out <a href="https://www.code4000.org" target="_blank">www.code4000.org</a>.
US folks should take a look at the
<a href="http://postprisonedu.org/" target="_blank">Post-Prison Education Program</a>
which helps support inmates and former prisoners learn life skills needed to
make their way back into society.

Thanks to Michael Taylor (co-founder of code4000),
Neal Barnaby (my host at Humber) and the fine men I met at
HMP Humber for an enriching day.
Their passion to learn is inspiring and
I look forward to returning soon.
