Ron Graham died last week, on July 6, 2020. He may not have been a household name but he was a giant in the mathematics community. One thing I appreciated most about him was how, in the tradition of Claude Shannon and Richard Feynman, he was a playful person who enjoyed many things outside his work focus, including juggling, unicycling, and puzzles of all kinds.

Graham was a great friend and patron of the famously transient mathematics wizard Paul Erdos. He also had a long time friendship with Scientific Amercian puzzle master Martin Gardner. Among many other topics, the interview videos below include fascinating reflections on his work, some of his notable colleagues, what it was like working at Bell Labs, and some of the most important unsolved problems of modern mathematics.
