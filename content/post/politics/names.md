I invite you to scroll through this site, provided by Al Jazeera:

<a href="https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2024/israel-war-on-gaza-10000-children-killed/" target="_blank">Know Their Names</a>

<!--more-->  

Scroll this page and stop at random positions. Read the name and age of the human being you see under your cursor. That represents a child who was alive, breathing, and laughing just a few months ago. Keep scrolling and keep reading names.

**Are you ok with this madness?** If you're not, speak up now. It's not to late to let your family, friends, coworkers, and everyone you care about know that you don't support genocide and ethnic cleansing. Never Again means wever Again for anyone.
