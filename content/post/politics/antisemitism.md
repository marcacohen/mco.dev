Here's a list of things that some people consider antisemitic (but are not):
<br>
<br>

<!--more-->  

1. Criticizing Israel
1. Opposing Zionism
1. Calling the Gaza War a genocide 
1. Labeling Israel an apartheid state
1. Calling for a ceasefire in Gaza
1. Supporting Palestinians' right of return
1. Advocating for a Free Palestine
1. Chanting "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"
1. Calling for an end to the Occupation
1. Supporting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott,_Divestment_and_Sanctions" target="_blank">Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement

None of those items are about the Jewish people or religion or culture. They are all positions on Israeli policies and actions, as well as calls for the liberation of, and equal rights for, the Palestinian people. None are antisemitic.

On whose authority, you may ask, do I make such a bold claim? As a Jewish person, I get to define what antisemitism means to me.
