When the people you love most,  
And who love you the most,  
In the whole world  

<!--more-->  

When the people you've grown up with,  
Who know everything about you,  
Every flaw and every virtue  

When the people you've loved  
All your life,  
And who've loved you right back  

When the people who've been there for you,  
And took care of you,  
Every single step of your journey  

What do you do when you discover  
They are the kind of people  
Who looked the other way  

While Jews were being marched
Into gas chambers?
