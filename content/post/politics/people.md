To my Jewish readers, I want you to do a thought experiment.

<!--more-->  

Imagine it was your people who were being decimated. Your children who were being slaughtered and traumatized. Your elderly parents who were being displaced from their homes, again and again and again. Your relatives and friends who lost their homes, their jobs, their schools, their places of worship, their Universities, everything they held dear destroyed.

All those horrible things have happened to the Jewish people. Given that history, how can we sit idly by while such atrocities are perpetrated by the self-proclaimed Jewish State? How can we quietly allow this to happen in our name?

Somehow it's easier to process violence when it happens to some group of people you feel unrelated to, thousands of miles away. But that's precisely how the Holocaust happened.

Every time you hear news about horrific attacks on Gaza, or the West Bank, or Lebanon, with such callous disregard for innocent lives, I want you to ask yourself: "how would I feel if it was my people?". 

Because it is your people. We are all one people on this planet.
