In his celebrated dystopian novel *1984*, George Orwell introduced the concept of Newspeak, which illustated how language can be used to control thought and behavior.

Some people say you can't use the word apartheid to describe the situation in the occupied territories because it's antisemitic. In the following video, in less than a minute, former US President Jimmy Carter explains why apartheid is "exactly accurate".

The point is not whether that word is accurate or not. People can disagree. But in a society that values free speech, it's critically important that we don't try to limit what people can say simply because we disagree with their conclusions.

Anyone who claims words like apartheid or genocide are antisemitic is trying to control your language by weaponizing antisemitism. You are free to use those words if you believe they apply, as I do.

Don't let them turn 2024 into 1984.
