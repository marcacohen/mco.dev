The phrase "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" has been declared antisemitic by supporters of Israel. It's been claimed that the phrase calls for the eradication of the state of Israel.

A few things I learned from the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_river_to_the_sea">Wikipedia article on this subject</a>

- The phrase was popularised in the 1960s as part of a wider call for Palestinian liberation creating a democratic state freeing Palestinians from living under Israel.

- Palestinian progressives use the phrase to call for a united democracy over the whole territory while others say "it's a call for peace and equality after ... decades-long, open-ended Israeli military rule over millions of Palestinians."

- Islamist militant faction Hamas used the phrase in its 2017 charter, which is probably why many consider it to call for the dismantling of Israel.

- The phrase has also been used by Israeli politicians. The 1977 election manifesto of the right-wing Israeli Likud party said: "Between the sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty."

Words and phrases can be interpreted differently by different people. In fact, only a few days ago, the phrase was used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu, who publicly stated "The State of Israel has to control the entire area from the river to the sea."

So which is it, antisemitic slur or rallying cry?

Here's what the phrase means to me: **there will be no place, anywhere in their original homeland, between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, where Palestinians will be subjugated, disenfranchised, and denied their basic human rights**.

In the past, I've hesitated to use the phrase, out of respect for the sensitivity of people who interpret it differently than me. But now that Israel is attempting to exterminate the Palestinians in Gaza, I'm no longer remaining silent.

I'm Jewish and I stand for Palestinian liberation. If you feel similarly, don't be afraid to speak up. Your voice is needed.
