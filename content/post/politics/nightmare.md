This is a great read from the Washington Post in case you ever wondered what it might be like to challenge a conspiracy mongering, hate spewing, xenophobic candidate for US Congress.

It's about as much fun as it sounds. This is America in 2020.

<br>

Four years ago, to the collective horror of reasonable people everywhere, we elected a vile, petty, self-obsessed narcissist to the most powerful position in our government. In his inauguration speech he famously said: "From this moment on, it's going to be America First." 1/5
His world view was distilled into those ten words, the notion that we were somehow better than everyone else. That attitude pervaded everything he did but it was just a preview of the carnage to come. For four long years we've watched his slow motion horror show... 2/5
...featuring children in cages, separated from their parents, climate change denial, xenophobia, corruption, and an endless list of atrocities (http://bit.ly/35T4KA6), culminating in mismanaging a crisis that, in one year, claimed more American deaths than World War II. 3/5
Despite his desperate attempts to cling to power, tomorrow morning he will leave the White House the same way he entered it: a sore loser, graceless, spewing contempt and vitriol for anything that violates his altered reality, a schoolyard bully, emboldened by money and attention, selling hatred to his minions. 4/5
It's hard to feel joy in this moment. It's more a sense of relief, like waking up and realizing that a nightmare wasn't real. Except this one was real. As Jefferson said "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance". I hope we  learn something from this nightmare. 5/5
