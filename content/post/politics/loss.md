There seems to be a widely held opinion that this election was close.

I think it's due to the fact that several states, like Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin, were indeed decided by less than 1% of votes cast. But when looking at the aggregate outcome, it's hard to characterize the result as anything but historically decisive.

This article from The Nation notes that, despite Trump's claim to have "WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!", you'd have to go back 88 years to find an incumbent loss by this margin - Biden won a higher precentage of the vote than any incumbent challenger since FDR defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932.

The president may deny reality, but he cannot change the fact that he is now losing the popular vote and the Electoral College by momentous margins.
