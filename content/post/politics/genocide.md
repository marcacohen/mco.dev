Some people see the situation in Gaza as a religious war. Some see it as a territorial dispute. Others see it as Israel's right to defend itself. But it's really much simpler than that.

At this point, it's no longer about religion, or land, or self-defense. What's going on right now is called genocide.

That's what you call it when one of world's strongest militaries cuts off a population of two million people from food, water, fuel, and electricity; uses monstrous 2,000 lb bombs (courtesy of the US) to relentlessly massacre innocent civilians, most of whom are women and children; systematically destroy hospitals, schools, and refugee camps; and displaces 80% of a population, reducing their homes and neighborhoods to rubble so they have nothing to return to.

Of all the countries on earth, Israel should know better because it was founded on the principle that Jews should be free from genocide. As it continues brazenly violating international law while the whole world watches, I'm reminded of Bob Dylan's words about another senseless war: "How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see? And how many deaths will it take 'til he knows that too many people have died?"
