Some things I bet you didn't know:

<br>

- Pez originated in Austria and was originally marketed as a smoking cessation aid.
- Pez tablets started out peppermint flavored. The name comes from the first, middle, and last letters in the German word for peppermint (pfefferminz).
- The transition from breath mint to fruit flavored candy was driven by the plan to market Pez to kids.
- The iconic Pez dispenser design is patented. 
- Some of the rarest Pez dispensers now sell for thousands of dollars.
