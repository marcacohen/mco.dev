I love this short interview from the New York Times with Jerry Seinfeld| about how he came up with one of his bits. I find his retelling of the creative process as funny as the actual delivery of this material, which I've found in other videos.

I consistently find the funniest people have one thing in common: they're all extremely smart and insightful.
