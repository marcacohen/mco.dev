I found this short list of life rules on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman/status/1218739120714985472), posted by an account named after Richard Feynman.

I failed to verify the authenticity of the source, however, I find it to be a nice, succinct expression of Feynman's core philosophy.

<br>

- Read everyday.
- Spend time with nature.
- Ask questions.
- Never stop learning.
- Don't pay attention to what others think of you.
- Do what interests you the most.
- Study hard.
- Teach others what you know.
- Make mistakes and learn.
- It's Okay to not know things!

One quote of his I have managed to authenticate is this gem:

> Genius is genetically determined. You inherit it from your children.

which I found in a video of Michelle Feynman describing life with her famously playful and iconoclastic father.
