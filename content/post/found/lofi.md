A Google Summer intern, <a href="https://vibertthio.com/portfolio/" target="_blank">Vibert Thio</a>, created this marvelously soothing interactive experience.

<!--more-->

It's a kind of old school explorable room rendered in warm pixelated graphics. But the real highlight is the music, generated by a machine learning algorithm, which you can configure to your own taste. Give it a try and see if you don't end up leaving it running in the background all day, like I did.

The underlying technology behind this demo is <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/" target="_blank">Magenta</a>, which is an open source project using Machine Learning technology to create compelling computer-generated music and art.

                      Welcome to Lo-Fi Player! By interacting with elements in the room, you can build
your own custom music room. You can also share your room with others. Or if you
prefer, just relax, listen, and enjoy the view from the window. The experience
is powered by machine learning models from <a href="https://magenta.tensorflow.org/js-announce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">magenta.js</a>.
