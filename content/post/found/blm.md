If you know about the history of racism in the US, especially in the deep south, this won't surprise you, but the vitriolic reactions are still jarring to see first hand. 

One thing that stands out for me is the most common refrain he hears, which asks why a white guy would take a stand for Black lives. They can't see to fathom why someone would care, no less make a public statement, on behalf of a group he's not part of. They just can't seem to process caring people who are in some way different from you.

Racism is everywhere in the US. It's just manifested in different ways. We're lucky that journalists like Rob Bliss exist, who are willing to shine a light on the parts of America that we'd rather not acknowledge, at significant risk to their own personal safety.
