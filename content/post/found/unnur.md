Unnur is an award winning short film about the life of a father and daughter in Iceland. It's a visually stunning meditation about the choices we make, how they shape our lives, and affect future generations. As one day blends into the next, we often fail to appreciate the beauty all around us. Take a moment out of your day and let this wonderful film take you to a place I bet you haven't been for a while.
