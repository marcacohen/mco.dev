Read these seven gripping first hand accounts of what's it like to be an ICU nurse in the midst of the pandemic. These people risk their lives every day to care for the sick and dying and to help the rest of us stay safe. Sadly, instead of gratitude, they often encounter scorn and contempt from an ill-informed and science denying public, encouraged by a pathological President.

They are heroes in every sense of the word, but we don't deserve them.
