Check out this amazing performance by a French dance troup, recorded in Berlin in 2016. The piece is entitled *Celui Qui Tombe* ("The One Who Falls") and the entire performance takes place on a tilting and rotating stage. At times, the dancers seem to defy the laws of gravity. It's a beautiful blend of modern dance, circus acrobatics, and performance art.
