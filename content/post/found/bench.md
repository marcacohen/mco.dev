Samuel Wilmot rates benches throughout the UK on Instagram. Seriously, that's what he does with most of his free time. And his reviews are sincere, thorough, and accurate.

Here's one of my favorites:

> River Street, Bristol. Unfortunately this bench was a victim of vandalism and the majority of the seat was missing. It did receive a 0/10, but I still hold it in a higher regard than some benches.

I love seeing people who care so deeply about a subject. It doesn't matter what it is, or whether I'm personally interested in the focus area. It's just nice to see such passion and dedication. I think it raises interesting questions about how we judge a productive life.

                      “The bench was comfortable, big broad arms, the seat was a good height and had a subtle curve, a great base, a plaque and a wonderful view. It’s a a very solid 7/10.”
