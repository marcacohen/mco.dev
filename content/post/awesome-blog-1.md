First in a series of articles on building a state of the art blog in 2017.<!--more-->

In the web era, there's an interesting way of thinking about your identity.
How many "home pages" have you published? As our lives unfold, and as web
technology matures, our virtual personas evolve on a parallel path, and
leave behind a digital trail.

### The Geocities Era

Courtesy of the [Way Back Machine](https://archive.org/web/),
here's a screenshot of one of my early sites,
circa 2000, hosted on the venerable/horrible geocities.com and lovingly crafted
with that state of the art authoring nightmare known as Microsoft Front Page 2000:

The biggest problem with this site was that it didn't change very often, which is
something of an understatement (there's that same vacation photo gallery again,
which now even bores my own Mom). This was around the time when the word 
"[blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog)" first joined the modern vernacular.
Intrepid explorers wanted a home on the web but we weren't quite sure
what to do with it once we got there.

### The WordPress Era

Around 2010, I discovered Wordpress, and started a self-published blog,
focusing on two of my passions. I published
[Song of the Day #1](http://mkcohen.com/song-of-the-day-1) (featuring a
video with a short blurb about why I liked the song or artist) on July 24, 2010,
and kept going for nearly a whole year, all the way up to
[Song of the Day #200](http://mkcohen.com/song-of-the-day-200). I also wrote
a thoroughly enjoyable (for me, at least) [Saturday puzzle series](http://mkcohen.com/category/puzzle).

My greatest triumph was [this article](http://mkcohen.com/how-the-web-works-in-one-easy-lesson),
which was once the top organic result returned by a Google search of "how the web works".
Sadly, I've now fallen to the digital Siberia page two results, but it was fun breathing
the rarified air of a top Google search result.

During this time, I learned a valuable lesson: **if you write about something you really love,
and you build up a little momentum, it's actually pretty easy to keep going.**
I wanted to keep blogging but in 2011 I got a job at Google and all my fun
side projects ground to a screeching halt. Another problem was that I really
wasn't thrilled with the machanics of my site. It had some serious shortcomings:

- It was hosted on a virtual server. If one of my articles made it to the front
page of Hacker News (which turned out to be an unjustified fear), I was a sitting duck.
- I had no support for https, which didn't seem terrible back then, but in 2017 that's inexcusable.
- Wordpress is a pretty amazing thing but I got tired of all the layers between me and my content.
I wanted a hacker's blogging platform.

### The Github/Hugo Era

Fast forward to 2017...web technology, content authoring tools, and cloud hosting have
all come a long way since my last experiment. 
Having recently transitioned to the Cloud Developer Relations team at Google,
I've built myself a new voice on the web, which you are now reading. I've learned
quite a bit In the process of building this blog.
In case others are interested in following suit, I'm writing this
series of articles to explain the choices I've made in the following dimensions:

- Content Strategy & Tooling
  - authoring flow
  - static vs. dynamic
  - server vs. client side rendering
- Source Code Management
- Continuous Integration
- Web Serving
- Comments & Feedback
- Offline & Mobile Support
- Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Analytics

The web is the most powerful publishing platform in the history of the world.
With the right technology choices, authoring a state of the art blog has never been easier.
I hope that my ruminations in this series will helps others take the plunge
and establish a digital persona. As I [once wrote](http://mkcohen.com/dont-forget-to-write):

> Many of us stop writing after our school days. The ghosts of arduous term papers haunt us at the thought of writing anything longer than a typical facebook update. And that’s unfortunate, because writing can really be fun and relaxing and good for you.

> When I started this site, I pondered a modern variation on that old “if a tree falls in the woods…” question: if I write a blog and no one reads it, will it have an impact? One year later, my answer is emphatically yes – the impact is on me. I’ve enjoyed writing it and I feel like the “writing part of my brain” is getting good exercise these days. And I get a great feeling every time I finish an article. If it entertains or informs anyone else, that makes me extra happy.
