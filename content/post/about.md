I'm an American software engineer working on Google's Developer Relations team in London.
My mission is building tools, demos, tutorials, and other educational artifacts to make computing and data science more accessible and inclusive.

Before joining Google, I spent 30 years building products and managing engineering teams in the Telecom industry (Bell Labs, AT&T, Lucent Technologies, and Alcatel-Lucent).

Things I'm interested in:

* teaching and learning
* productivity and study hacks
* computing, math, puzzles, and chess
* books, music, theater, and film
