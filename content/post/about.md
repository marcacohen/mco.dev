My mission is building tools, demos, tutorials, and other educational artifacts to make computing and data science more accessible and inclusive.

Before joining Google, I spent 30 years building products and managing engineering teams in the Telecom industry (Bell Labs, AT&T, Lucent Technologies, and Alcatel-Lucent).

Things I'm interested in:

* teaching and learning
* productivity and study hacks
* computing, math, and puzzles
* books, music, theater, and film
