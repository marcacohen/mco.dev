I build tools, demos, tutorials, and other artifacts to make
computing and data science accessible and fun for everyone.

I'm an American Expat working at Google in London. I have 30
years of experience building products, developing software,
and managing technical teams, mostly in the Telecom industry
(Bell Labs, AT&T, Lucent Technologies, Alcatel-Lucent).

Things I'm interested in:

* teaching and learning
* productivity science and hacks
* computing, math, and puzzles
* great books, music, theater, film, and other arts
