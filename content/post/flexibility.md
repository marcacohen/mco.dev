I learned something today, something I think is kind of important, and which might perhaps be of interest to other people who are prone to the same kind of behavior.

I had an idea to propose to someone. But I wasn't neutral about this idea. I had an agenda. I wanted this person to agree with my position so that we could implement my plan. I made my case, detailing all the reasons why I thought my argument made sense. The feedback I got was generally supportive but several questions were raised, all of which I deemed to be mostly irrelevant. I quickly became frustrated and angry about these trivial concerns jeopardizing my wonderful proposal.

I realized afterward that this has been a recurring pattern in my life. You see, I don't just come up with ideas – I fall in love with them. I work hard to make sure my thinking is clear, accurate, and thorough. I'm so persuaded by the logical purity and the compelling justifications, that any criticism is perceived as an attack, any questions are seen as a potential threat to my precious plan.

Passion is a good thing. Believing in yourself and your ideas is important. Caring enough to thing things through carefully and thoughtfully, especially in the era of the attention economy, is excellent good. But here's where I go wrong: having a good plan is not the same thing as being right. 

How many times in your life have you been wrong? How many times has someone opened your eyes to a different way of thinking about a problem or a different kind of solution? It's happened to me **a lot**. That's because when you have an idea, regardless of how well fleshed out you think it is, it's really just a starting point. It's the product of exactly one person's perspective. It may be perfect, but it will probably still benefit from addition set's of eyes and ears.

But it's not enough to seek feedback. You have to be genuinely open to hearing it. If you're so busy thinking about counterarguments, or why their missing the point of your beautiful ideas, then why even bother getting their input to begin with? You've already made up your mind. If you really want someone's feedback, you have to actually listen to it.

Easier said than done, right? How do you do that? Intellectually, I get it. But when I'm excited about my pet idea, it's no fun hearing about it's perceived shortcomings. How do I put this zen-like ideal into practice when my idea is so good and this person just doesn't get it?

I've struggled with this for a long time and I think I've finally found the answer. Here it is:

    Keep your mouth shut.

When you ask someone their opinion, let them give it to you and don't respond with any sentence that starts with the word “but”. The only acceptable responses should come from this family:

* Good point.
* I hadn't thought about that.
* Can you say more about X?
* Any additional thoughts?
* What do you think about variation Y?
* Thanks for your feedback.

The idea here is to consider this a chance to get someone else's perspective, not to have a debate, not to negotiate a deal. If the feedback is not what you expected, go away and think about it. If you still think your idea has merit, and you alone are responsible for its implementation, then just do it. 

If you have to work together with others, then after you've listened to your feedback from people you trust,
arrange a second conversation to focus on reconciling your differences. After some time has passed, you'll have moved from an emotional reaction to a measured intellectual reaction, which I guarantee will go over better.

If you can adopt this strategy, you'll not only open your mind to better solutions to your problems. You'll also be a nicer person to spend time with.
