This week’s puzzle is an original trivia quiz with a twist.
<!--more-->
The answer to each question is the name of a famous person, where the last name of one answer gives the first name of the next answer (give or take a letter or two). The resulting sequence of answers form a chain, like this one: Elton John, John Wayne, Wayne Brady, etc. See how many names you can find and post your answers in a comment below. If you get stuck, googling is allowed. Have a great weekend!
