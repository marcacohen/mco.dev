In front of you are three boxes. One contains only apples, one contains only oranges and one contains a mix of apples and oranges.<!--more-->

Each box is labeled, like this:

- Box 1: “apples”
- Box 2: “oranges”
- Box 3: “apples & oranges”

Unfortunately, all three boxes are mislabeled. That’s where you come in – you’re going to help me fix those labels.

Here’s the challenge: You get to choose one, and only one, box. I will remove a randomly selected piece of fruit from your chosen box and show it to you (so you can tell if it’s an apple or an orange). After that, you will be able to accurately and definitively relabel all three boxes.

Choose wisely, grasshopper, and don’t forget to eat your fruit!
