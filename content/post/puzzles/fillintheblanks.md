I was in sixth grade when I first saw this puzzle and it captivated me for a few days, because I have no problem wasting ridiculous amounts of time on useless activities (like this blog).

Each line below contains a phrase involving a number and only the first letter of each word. Your job is to figure out the missing letters and complete each phrase. For example, if the challenge was “50 W to L your L”, you might recognize that Paul Simon song “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”.

This is the kind of puzzle where answers will pop into your head when you’re not even thinking about it, so take your time with it and let your subconscious mind do the heavy lifting.
