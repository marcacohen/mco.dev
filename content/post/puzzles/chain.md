This weekâ€™s puzzle is an original trivia quiz where the answers are linked together into a chain.

<!--more-->

The answer to each question is the name of a famous person, where the last name of each answer gives the first name of the next answer (give or take a letter or two). The resulting sequence of answers form a chain. It's a circular chain, i.e. the bottom of the list connects to the first entry in the same fashion.

See how many names you can find and let me know if you like it. Googling is allowed and encouraged!
