This puzzle is fun and not too difficult if you take your time. 

<!--more-->

It's easier if you use grab a pencil and paper to keep things straight. If you don't get it right away, take a break and come back to it later. I guarantee you'll enjoy it way more if you solve it for yourself.

- You have three hats before you labelled Hat 1, Hat 2, and Hat 3.
- Exactly one of these hats has a cat inside.
- Each hat is labeled with an assertion, but *only one of these assertions is true*:
  - Hat 1's label says "The cat is in this hat".
  - Hat 2's label says "The cat is not in this hat".
  - Hat 3's label says "The cat is not in hat 1".

<h4>Your challenge is to tell me which hat contains the cat.</h4>

No matter what you do, don't watch this spoiler video, unless you'd like to check your answer. :)
