True love happens once in your life.  
Maybe twice if you're lucky.  
Maybe never if you're not.  
<!--more-->

Love comes to you when it's ready.  
Not when you're ready.  
Love doesn't care about your schedule.  
Or your responsibilities. Or your needs.  

Love whispers quietly into your ear.  
And divulges the wisdom of the ages.  
You choose whether to listen or not.  

Love tells us that  
After all is said and done,  
We are primal creatures of the earth.  
And all that really matters in this life,  
Is that we find someone  
Who shows us  
Why we exist.
