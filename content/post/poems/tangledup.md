> She was married when we first met  
> Soon to be divorced  
> I helped her out of a jam I guess  
> But I used a little too much force  
> We drove that car as far as we could  
> Abandoned it out west  
> Split up on a dark sad night  
> Both agreeing it was best  
>
> She turned around to look at me  
> As I was walkin' away  
> I heard her say over my shoulder  
> We'll meet again someday  
> On the avenue  
> Tangled up in Blue  
>
