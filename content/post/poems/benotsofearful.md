Be not so nervous, be not so frail  
<!--more-->
{{< youtube aZnahF3mtNI >}}
Someone watches you, you will not fail  
Be not so nervous, be not so frail  
Be not so nervous, be not so frail  
  
Be not so sorry for what you've done  
You must forget them now, it's done  
And when you wake up you will find you can run  
Be not so sorry for what youâ€™ve done  
   
Be not so fearful, be not so pale  
Someone watches you, you will not leave the rails  
Be not so fearful, be not so pale  
Be not so fearful, be not so pale  
   
Be not so sorry for what you've done  
You must forget them now, it's done  
And when you wake up you will find you can run  
Be not so sorry for what you've done
