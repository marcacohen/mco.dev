We exist in the minds of others.  
<!--more-->    
Their memories of us,  
Both good and bad,  
Are where we live.  
For that's all we are,  
And all we'll ever be.  
  
But as we get older,   
Those memories fade  
Along with their spirits.  
And with each loss,  
A little bit of us  
Disappears.  
  
My parents are dead.   
My grandparents too.  
Everyone who ever shared   
Their DNA with me  
And their version of the truth  
Is now gone.  

But I'm not alone.  
I once had five  
Who helped me survive  
Now there are three  
Who still love me  
Unconditionally.  

That's enough.
