My mother is dead.  
You can’t tell by looking at her,  
But she’s gone.  
<!--more-->
 
A joyful, proud, strong woman  
Full of charm and finesse,  
Has been replaced,  
By a cold and callous shell.  

I tell myself she’ll get better.  
She’s just going through a phase.  
She’s a prisoner  
Waiting for parole.  

But in the middle of the night,  
I know  
She’s not coming back.
