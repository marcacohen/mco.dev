Yesterday, my friend Ali tweeted a lovely original limerick about Node.js and invited his followers to contribute more. Challenge accepted.

Here are my contributions, along with translations for non-programmers (**TfNP**):

> *There was a young man from Spain.  
> Java, he sought to explain.  
> But his students got stuck,  
> Asked him "what in the fuck,  
> is a  public static void main()"?*

**TfNP**: Java forces inscrutible syntax onto the most basic beginners. 

> *Young Bjarne was not one to cuss  
> But one day he raised quite a fuss  
> Said he "I find it crass  
> That C has no class,  
> So I think I'll invent C plus plus"*  

**TfNP**: Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ because it's predecessor, C, lacked object oriented features, aka classes.

> *Mr. Eich, co-founder of Mozilla  
> Thought it would be quite a thrilla  
> If, in ten frantic days,  
> JavaScript could he raise,  
> The web's six thousand pound gorilla*

**TfNP**: In only ten days, Brendan Eich invented JavaScript, which became the de facto runtime engine in every web browser on Earth.

> *Mr. Pike had reached a plateau  
> Discovered Python was too slow  
> The powers that be  
> Told him no lunch is free  
> So he said "Then I'll take mine to Go"*

**TfNP**: Frustrated with Python build times for Google production services, Rob Pike invented the Go programming language.

> There once was a guy named Ritchie  
> Who wanted to make programs easy  
> Said he "I am sad  
> Languages are so bad  
> But now I am able to C!"

**TfNP**: Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language to make it easier to write system programs. Unix, the precursor to Linux, was written in C by Ritchie, Ken Thompson, and a host of collaborators. Fifty years later, C is still one of the world's most popular programming languages.

> An arrogant techbro named Earl  
> Said "my code is a joy to unfurl"  
> But no one could say  
> If his claim was okay   
> Because he'd been coding in Perl  

**TfNP**: Perl lives up to the moniker "code". Alan Turing wouldn't understand most Perl programs.

> Mr. Wall said "my code makes me hurl,  
> So I'll give code design a good whirl!"  
> He mixed up some piles  
> Of Scrabble game tiles  
> The result, as we know, is called Perl.  

**TfNP**: Again, Perl is a write-only programming language.
