Yesterday, my friend Ali tweeted a lovely original limerick about Node.js and invited his followers to contribute more. Challenge accepted.

Here are my contributions, along with translations for non-programmers (**TfNP**):

<br>

*There was a young man from Spain.  
Java, he sought to explain.  
But his students got stuck,  
Asked him "what in the fuck,  
is a  public static void main()"?*

**TfNP**: Java forces inscrutible syntax onto the most basic beginners. 

<br>

*Young Bjarne was not one to cuss  
But one day he raised quite a fuss  
Said he "I find it crass  
That C has no class,  
So I think I'll invent C plus plus"*  

**TfNP**: Bjarne Stroustrup created C++ because it's predecessor, C, lacked object oriented features, aka classes.

<br>

*Mr. Eich, co-founder of Mozilla  
Thought it would be quite a thrilla  
If, in ten frantic days,  
JavaScript could he raise,  
The web's six thousand pound gorilla*

**TfNP**: In only ten days, Brendan Eich invented JavaScript, which became the de facto runtime engine in every web browser on Earth.

<br>

*Mr. Pike had reached a plateau  
Discovered Python was too slow  
The powers that be  
Told him no lunch is free  
So he said "Then I'll take mine to Go"*

**TfNP**: Frustrated with Python build times for Google production services, Rob Pike invented the Go programming language.
