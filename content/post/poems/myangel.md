<!--more-->
I have an angel in my life.  

Once upon a time she was my little girl.  
I held her in my arms, and I watched her grow.  
When she smiled at me, I felt happy to be alive.  

Now she's all grown up.  
She has angels of her own.  
But she's still my little girl.  

Once I took care of her.  
Now she takes care of me.  
She's my angel.
