I love this video of Jimmy Page on two levels.

I find it fascinating to hear a living legend analyze one of his most loved creations. But the way in which he listens really draws me in. He plays the song on vinyl, resting the tone arm by hand, and then sits back to let the music flow out of the turntable. He holds the record cover in his hands, regards the cover art, and re-reads the lyrics, which, in those days, were often provided with the record.

It brings me back to a bygone era when listening to music felt more deliberate and more contemplative.

Bonus track: Heart performs Stairway to Heaven live to the members of Led Zeppelin, who are receiving Kennedy Center Honors. They are accompanied on drums by the son of their deceased bandmate John Bonham.
