One of my favorite movies is *Adaptation*, in no small part because of the way it cleverly refers to itself. It's a movie about a movie (actually it's a movie about a movie about a book). If that doesn't make sense, try watching it and you'll see what I mean.

The video below, from a Youtube channel on screenwriting, is an expertly made tribute to that film. It applies the same kind of self-reference to creating a video essay about creating a video essay about Adaptation. Like the film it's ostensibly about, it'll blow your mind.

Incidentally, the guy who wrote *Adaptation*, [Charlie Kaufman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kaufman), specializes in these sort of mind bending motifs. He also wrote *Being John Malkovich*, and *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, among others.
