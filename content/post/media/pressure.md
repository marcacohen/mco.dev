I love when people cover a great old song, not just following the original formula, but adding something special.

Johnny Cash's version of Nine Inch Nails' *Hurt* comes to mind. This one is in the class of originality. An unlikely pair of artists, Karen O and Willie Nelson, took a song just about everyone knows and loves and totally made it their own. Enjoy...
