I love when an artist covers a great old song, not just following the original formula, but adding something special.

Johnny Cash's version of Nine Inch Nails' *Hurt* comes to mind. This one is in the same class of originality. An unlikely duo, Karen O and Willie Nelson, took a song just about everyone knows and loves and totally made it their own. Enjoy...
