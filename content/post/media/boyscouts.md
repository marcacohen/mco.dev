It takes incredible courage for a victim to report their persecution, but especially so for a child to speak up against an adult. Watch this captivating and beautifully made short film to see how a young man tried to do the right thing, to protect other children from abuse by a serial predator, and was further victimized by an organization that placed their public relations image ahead of the safety of the children entrusted to their care.
