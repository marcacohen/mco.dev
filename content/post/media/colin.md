I really enjoyed seeing Colin Hay perform live in London last Friday night. You'd have to be a certain age to remember Men At Work but whether you know his music or not, he's a captivating performer - a guitar virtuoso, his voice sounds great, and he's just an incredibly funny and self-deprecating story teller.
