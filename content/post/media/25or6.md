The best video I saw this week was this incredible fingerstyle guitar rendition of Chicago's classic hit from 1970 "25 or 6 to 4".

If you've never heard this song, it's a masterpiece of 70s up-tempo rock and roll.  From the iconic opening riff, Ken Nishimura has captured the essence of this frenetic song on his acoustic guitar. The percussion alone is incredible, but he's playing both guitars, bass, drums, multiple vocal lines, and even the horn section.

Check out the video below - it's astounding.
