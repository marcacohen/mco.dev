Back in November of 2018 Dave Matthews recorded a solo performance at NPR's legendary Tiny Desk.

I especially love the first song, "Samurai Cop (Oh Joy Begin)". It's one of those songs that works even better for me in this solo acoustic arrangement. But here's what I enjoy the most: watch Dave's face during this song. So full of passion and emotion, it conveys the primal joy of music, and it fits the lyrics perfectly. Don't miss the short interlude after the song when he makes fun of this very aspect of his own performance.
