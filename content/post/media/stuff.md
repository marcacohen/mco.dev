I've been following this YouTube channel for a few years and it never ceases to amaze me.

<!--more-->

The name of the channel is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StuffMadeHere" target="_blank">Stuff Made Here</a>. It's basically a guy who spends months of his life building absolutely insane projects, like a bat that can hit a baseball further than any human, a basketball hoop you literally can't miss (see video embedded below), a pool cue that shoots perfectly every time, and an attachment for your arm that launches a frisbee fast enough to kill you (or him, if it backfires).

The channel is one crazy idea after another but, unlike most of us, he actually turns his ideas into reality. The real story here is less about the end product and more about the journey. It's inspiring to watch how he gets (metaphorically, but sometimes literally) knocked down, over and over, yet keeps getting up and trying a new approach.

His engineering skills are incredible and his presentation style is earnest, genuine, and self-deprecating. He just a nice, smart guy who has enough engineering skills, serious tools, and time on his hands to build pretty much anything.

There's a lesson here: even if a project seems pointless, **especially if it seems pointless**, give it a try. You'll have a lot of fun and, if you're not careful, you might learn something.
