I was in sixth grade when I first saw this puzzle (thanks to Miss LaRusso) and it captivated me for three straight days, which tells you something about my personality: 1) I love a challenge, 2) I’m very determined, and 3) I have no problem wasting ridiculous amounts of time on useless activities (like this blog). But enough about me, let’s talk about today’s puzzle.

Each line below contains a phrase involving a number and only the first letter of each word. Your job is to figure out the missing letters and complete each phrase. For example, if the challenge was “50 W to L your L”, you might recognize that old Paul Simon song “50 Ways to Leave Your Lover”. Submit as many answers as you can find in a comment below.

This is the kind of puzzle where answers will pop into your head when you’re not even thinking about the phrases, so take your time. On Tuesday, I’ll post the names of the people who find the most correct answers. And for the puzzle obsessed among us, I apologize in advance for ruining your weekend.
