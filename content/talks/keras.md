This talk covers a quick summary of recent progress in Machine Learning (both inside and outside of Google),
and provides an overview of Keras, a simple, intuitive abstraction layer that makes it easier to use TensorFlow
and other ML frameworks. The talk culminates in a hands-on lab, in which we'll use Keras to build and deploy
a convolutional neural network using Google TPUs (special purpose hardware).
