The promise of the Cloud is to allow you to focus on your problem domain and
stop worrying about resource constraints and administration headaches. In this
guided, 60 minute tutorial, we’ll start with a simple data processing problem,
and then add layers and complexity until we’ve built a robust, scalable, and
repeatable data science solution, including data cleaning, pipeline processing,
health monitoring and a summary dashboard, all using serverless cloud technology.
