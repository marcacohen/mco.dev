This talk reviews some challenging math problems and shows how they can be solved numerically,
using moderately simple computer programs. Along the way, we'll see how to simulate the problems
in software, discover some surprising results, and learn a bit of Python. All programs will be
made available after the talk in an interactive notebook you can run yourself.
