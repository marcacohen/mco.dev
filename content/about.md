I'm a Developer Advocate at Google. I build tools, demos, codelabs, 
and other assets to enhance the developer experience on the 
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).
I'm originally from New Jersey, spent some time in Columbus and 
Seattle, and I now live and work in London, UK. I'm politically liberal
and not shy about sharing my opinions.

I'm co-author of the O'Reilly book on
[Google Compute Engine](https://bit.ly/gce-book).
I co-wrote the 
[demo app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPtJd6AzU8c&feature=youtu.be&t=39m19s)
used to announce Google Compute Engine at Google I/O 2012. In a previous life,
I built communication systems at
[Bell Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs).
and Lucent Technologies.
Outside of work, I enjoy indie music, quirky films
(especially documentaries), books, teaching, puzzles,
and chess. Thanks for visiting and feel free
