## Who am I?

Hi there, you can call me Sam. I'm a 1m96 tall guy from Belgium and that will probably be the answer to the question that pops up in your head when you see me.

## What do I do?

I am a Xamarin developer at [3factr](http://3factr.be/). At the moment I am working on four of the top ten most downloaded news apps in Belgium.

## Xamarin?

Xamarin enables you to develop Android and iOS apps in C#, the most beautiful programming language mankind has ever seen. I have been a certified Xamarin mobile developer since July 2016. 

## How can you contact me?

You should send me an email at [s@muel.be](mailto:s@muel.be) or a tweet at [@SamuelDebruyn](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=SamuelDebruyn).

## What do I do for fun?

I once was a guitarist in a local indie rock band, but nowadays I just like to go to concerts, travel and meet up with friends.

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
