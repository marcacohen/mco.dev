Monday was the last day of my internship at [RealDolmen](http://realdolmen.com). For the past 12 weeks, I was a Xamarin developer creating an Android, iOS and a Windows Phone app for [RealDolmen Education](http://education.realdolmen.com).

On June 9th, I'll be giving a presentation to my mentors and a few other lecturers about my internship and if all goes well, I'll then graduate.

I really would like to thank the awesome people at RealDolmen for guiding and supporting me: Nico, Wesley, Jonathan, Daniyar, James, Alexander, Hannes, Tom, Danny, Fred, Erik and everyone else I forgot...! I learned a lot from them and it's a great working environment.

In the next few weeks, I'll be working on the second part of my dissertation which mostly consists of documentation about my internship. In the meantime, you can already [browse through the code](https://github.com/SamuelDebruyn/education-xamarin-app).

This would probably also be a good time to thank all the people at [Odisee](http://odisee.be). My fellow students, the lecturers, the staff, everybody at the ASR (student council)... The past three years have been a great adventure with lots of interesting and great experiences. On my first day, I didn't know anyone and while I had some knowledge about software development (doesn't seem much compared with where I am today), I didn't have any real experience. That isn't the case anymore today. I've learned so much on a lot of different levels. My work at the student council also contributed to this. There are too many people I'd like to thank, so I'm not even going to try to list them all. Thank you, to all of you.

### So... what's next?

On May 9th, I'm starting as a Xamarin developer at [Cozmos](http://cozmos.be/). They're an awesome company with awesome people and they make awesome mobile apps. Awesome, right? They have the best Xamarin developers in Belgium, so I'm really looking forward to learning from and working with them.

Be sure to check out [Cozmos' website](http://cozmos.be/) and if you ever are in need of a mobile app, or you have an app and you want to make it more awesome, you know where to find us.
